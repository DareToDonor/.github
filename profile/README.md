# Dare To Donor
## Hi There ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the official GitHub profile of D2D (Dare To Donor) developed by Bangkit CH2-PS258! ðŸš€

We are committed to developing an integrated blood donation application. Our application serves as a centralized platform for tracking blood bank availability, providing real-time updates on donation events and news, and enabling users to maintain a comprehensive donation history. Leveraging machine learning capabilities, the application will forecast blood supply demand, fostering a more efficient and timely donation process.
